    My research focuses on security and privacy in widely used computer systems and networks. I have helped detect and evade Internet censorship, measured geographic discimination by content providers, uncovered vulnerabilities in widespread Internet protocols, and worked to prevent HTTPS certificate misissuance. I am also interested in answering questions about practical properties of privacy systems and understanding the concrete improvement in security that different practices achieve.

    I enjoy teaching. While earning my Ph.D., I spent a semester as a lecturer for our undergraduate computer security course. Iâ€™ve also served as a teaching assistant and discussion lecture leader. To be and effective teacher, I strive to provide significance beyond mere transactional grading, by showing students why course material is relevant to the real world and sharing my passion for computing.
