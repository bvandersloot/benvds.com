  <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by J. Alex Halderman. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2015 as a Bachelor of Science, Engineering in Computer Science with a Mathematics Minor. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:benvds@umich.edu">benvds@umich.edu</a>, and my <a href="/cv">CV is available here</a>.</p>

  <p>I am interested in Computer Security and Privacy broadly. My research interests are problems that affect policy discussions and the use of measurement as a tool to make precise claims about the Internet in these discussions. Currently, I am working on providing additional insight into the phenomenon of Internet censorship. Previous work includes a meta-measurement study of the HTTPS certificate ecosystem and the proposal of a new, malicious cryptocurrency. As part of this, I am a contributer to the Censys Search Engine.</p>
