    My research focuses on computer security and privacy, with a focus on systems that benefit typical users. I have helped detect and evade censorship, measured geoblocking, helped uncover issues in widespread Internet protocols, and helped prevent certificate misissuance.
    I am also interested in answering questions about practical properties of privacy systems and understanding the concrete improvement in security with different practices.

    I enjoy teaching, and have had a few opportunities to do so as a grad student. I lectured one semester and taught a discussion section another.
    The challenge I believe is most important to the effectiveness of a teacher is to provide significance beyond transactional grading.
    While I am not perfect at this I continue to try to improve, e.g. by making course material tie into practical projects and making attendance voluntary.
