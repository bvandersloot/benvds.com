    Internet censorship and network interference have become widespread in many 
    countries, and an emerging body of work has sought to bring transparency to 
    these practices through techniques that can remotely measure connectivity 
    disruptions. Remote measurement tools can now detect DNS- and IP-based 
    blocking at global scale; however, a major unmonitored form of interference 
    is blocking triggered by deep packet inspection of application-layer data. 
    We close this gap by introducing a scalable, remote measurement system that 
    can efficiently detect application-layer interference. We show that our 
    technique can effectively detect application-layer blocking triggered on 
    HTTP and TLS headers, and it is flexible enough to support many other 
    diverse protocols. In experiments, we test for blocking across 4,458 
    autonomous systems, an order of magnitude larger than provided by country 
    probes used by OONI. We also test a corpus of 100,000 keywords from vantage 
    points in 40 countries to produce detailed national blocklists. Finally, we 
    analyze the keywords we find blocked to provide insight into the 
    application-layer blocking ecosystem and compare countries’ behavior. We 
    find that the most consistently blocked services are related to 
    circumvention tools, pornography, and gambling, but that there is 
    significant country-to-country variation.

    The HTTPS certificate ecosystem has been of great interest to the measurement
    and security communities. Without any ground truth, researchers have attempted
    to study this PKI from a variety of fragmented perspectives, including passively
    monitored networks, scans of the popular domains or the IPv4 address space,
    search engines such as Censys, and Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. In this
    work, we comparatively analyze all these perspectives. We find that aggregated
    CT logs and Censys snapshots have many properties that complement each other,
    and that together they encompass over 99% of all certificates found by any of
    these techniques. However, they still miss 1.5% of certificates observed in a
    crawl of all domains in .com, .net, and .org. We go on to illustrate how this
    combined perspective affects results from previous studies. In light of these
    findings, we have worked with the operators of Censys to incorporate CT log
    data into its results going forward, and we recommend that future HTTPS
    measurement adopt this new vantage.

    Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin has used a hash-based proof-of-work to
    generate new blocks, and create a single public ledger of transactions. The
    hash-based computational puzzle employed by Bitcoin is instrumental to its
    security, preventing Sybil attacks and making double-spending attacks more
    difficult. However, there have been concerns over the efficiency of this
    proof-of-work puzzle, and alternative “useful” proofs have been proposed. In
    this paper, we present DDoSCoin, which is a cryptocurrency with a malicious
    proof-of-work. DDoSCoin allows miners to prove that they have contributed to a
    distributed denial of service attack against specific target servers. This
    proof involves making a large number of TLS connections to a target server,
    and using cryptographic responses to prove that a large number of connections
    has been made. Like proof-of-work puzzles, these proofs are inexpensive to
    verify, and can be made arbitrarily difficult to solve.

    We investigate the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange as used in popular
    Internet protocols and find it to be less secure than widely believed. First,
    we present a novel flaw in TLS that allows a man-in-the-middle to downgrade
    connections to “export-grade” Diffie-Hellman. To carry out this attack, we
    implement the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. After a week-long
    precomputation for a specified 512-bit group, we can compute arbitrary
    discrete logs in this group in minutes. We find that 82% of vulnerable servers
    use a single 512-bit group, allowing us to compromise connections to 7% of
    Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites. In response, major browsers are being changed
    to reject short groups. We go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768- and
    1024-bit groups. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are in use by
    millions of TLS, SSH, and VPN servers. Performing precomputations on a few of
    these groups would allow a passive eavesdropper to decrypt a large fraction of
    Internet traffic. In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such computations are
    plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA
    leaks shows that the agency’s attacks on VPNs are consistent with having
    achieved such a break. We conclude that moving to stronger key exchange
    methods should be a priority for the Internet community.
