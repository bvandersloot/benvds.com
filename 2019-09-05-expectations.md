I think one of the best pieces of advice that I got too late for grad school was the advice to make expectations as explicit as possible when you are working underneath someone. It turns out ambiguity generally favors the person in power, whether they know it or not. Either party can force a line to be drawn, so make sure to persist and get a bar to clear up on the pole. It is a lot easier than practicing your high jump without a bar and having your coach tell you if you are doing any good.
