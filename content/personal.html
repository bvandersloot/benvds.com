	I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://www.cse.umich.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by <a href="https://jhalderm.com">J. Alex Halderman</a>. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2015 as a Bachelor of Science, Engineering in Computer Science with a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math">Mathematics Minor</a>. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:benvds@umich.edu">benvds@umich.edu</a>, and my CV is <a href="./cv">available here</a>.

	I am interested in Computer Security and Privacy broadly. 
	My research interests are problems that affect policy discussions and the use of measurement as a tool to make precise claims about the Internet in these discussions. 
	Currently, I am working on providing additional insight into the phenomenon of Internet censorship. 
	Previous work includes a meta-measurement study of the HTTPS certificate ecosystem and the proposal of a new, malicious cryptocurrency. 
	As part of this, I am a contributer to the <a href="https://censys.io">Censys Search Engine</a>.
