<p>My blog is a way for me to get my thoughts out there, even when they are
not entire academic publications. I believe that getting ideas out there, even
in raw form, is probably one of the best things I can do with my website, so
I made this.</p> 

<p>Of course, retrospective idealism aside, it is also just as much an excuse 
to practice writing. My PhD studies seem to put bursts of writing between long
spans of just programming; this isn't the best way to become a better writer.
Not to mention, my desire to write more coincided with 
<a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>, and I wanted
a platform to publish.
